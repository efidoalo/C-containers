# C-containers
Data containers designed to hold generic data types written in C. 
Currently implemented data structures include:
Vector, linked lists (uni and bi directional), Binary tree (self balanced insertion and deletion).
Each data structure implementation is contained within its own header file, to be included as necessary by anybody who 
wishes to use them in their code.
